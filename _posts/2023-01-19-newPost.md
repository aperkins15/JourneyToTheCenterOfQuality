Ok, so that entire thing was a complete and total shit show.  I've done so many commits and reverts...let's put it this way, this history on this repo is NASTY.  AND to top it off, github is struggling today so I thought my repo wasn't deploying because of something I did.  Nope, so there's a bunch of dirty commits and junk until I realized it was them and not me.

I'm still going to figure out the slides thing.  I just cannot figure out how to get it into my repo.  And these folks that post the introductions and how to get started....well, they assume you know shit that you don't know.  Well, friend, I have no idea how to make a .js into an ES module so that I can run it...like, come on.  Even my google fu failed me.  

Oh well, I'll figure it out, one way or another.  But, for now, I'm not going to figure it out.  I'm going to go do other stuff.
