So, it's been a hot minute since I wrote anything.  So, we're calling this a fresh start, a new start.  Just as I've got another new start.  I'm now one of the mods for a new testers slack, https://www.indie-testing.community/ The Indie Testing Community.  Not really going to get into the details of the why, if you know you know, but I'm happy we decided to re-create our community. We are small but we are connected and mighty.  And, we're a great bunch of folks!!  I love my tester friends!!

But, I'm also going to try some new things in my job.  My leader and I are exploring an idea.  I don't want to get too far into the details for now but someone in our testing community noted they would be interested in following along on this journey.  So, maybe if I use my blog as a sort of diary (not only just for this journey, but other journeys as well) I can share our experience with others and it may help them too.  

Now, I can't say that I will be very good about keeping this up, but I will try my hardest.  And, it might also turn into a really great talk one day.  So maybe I should be diligent and keep notes.  

So, come with me as I set out on this journey.  And, if you want to follow along with my shenanigans, it could be a fun time!!

Have an awesome day!
