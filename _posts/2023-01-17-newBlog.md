So, I figured I should try to try this github pages thing and start up my own repo.  Probably no one will find or read this, but what the hell?  Why not?

I have always used some sort of slide show app for my talks - oh, I give conference talks, btw - and it's fine.  But, I see my dev friends (bc I'm a Quality Architect) write all these cool slides and they're all custom and fancy and I pay money for an application to make mine fancy.  So, I figured I would try to spin up my own repo and create my own slides.  What could go wrong?  So, as an experiment, I'm going to create the slides and blog about my experience.

Who knows?  it might actually become a conference talk...
